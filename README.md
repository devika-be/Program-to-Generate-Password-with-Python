Project - Python Program to Generate Password

To write a Python program to create a password, declare a string of numbers + uppercase + lowercase + special characters. Take a random sample of the string of a length given by the user.

In the above code, I first imported the random module in Python, then I asked for user input for the length of the password. Then I stored the letters, numbers and special characters that I want to be considered while generating a password. Then I am doing a random sampling by joining the length of the password and the variable s, which will finally generate a random password.
